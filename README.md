# De Slechtst Denkbare App
"Slechtst Denkbare" improv game display app

A little web app that was originally developed for showing suggestions at our "World's Worst" improv show at Cafe The Joker on 30/09/2015, but is now used for training and performing quick-fire improv games in the style of "Lines You Wouldn't Hear" or "Worst possible <profession>". For performances, you can configure how often the audience should be involved in making a suggestion.
