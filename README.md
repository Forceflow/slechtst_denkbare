# De Slechtst Denkbare App
A "Slechtst Denkbare" improv game display app - live at **www.slechtstdenkbare.be**

A little web app that was originally developed for showing suggestions at our _"World's Worst"_ improv show at [Cafe The Joker](http://www.cafethejoker.be/) in september 2015, but is now used for training and performing quick-fire improv games in the style of _"Lines You Wouldn't Hear"_ or _"Worst possible <profession>"_. 

* The app remembers which cards it has already shown to you, even over multiple sessions. You can reset this using the options menu.
* For performances, you can configure how often the audience should be involved in making a suggestion. (Every X cards).
* Thanks to [Twinters](https://github.com/twinters), the app is now a mobile-compatible web app you can add to your home screen.
* Suggestions for content to be added can be made using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMRoif8uh3CGwaXHmuRLflB6kYLQpwFVQp2WVeE8Y7cgVW3A/viewform).
