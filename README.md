# De Slechtst Denkbare App
A "Slechtst Denkbare" improv game display app

A little web app that was originally developed for showing suggestions at our "World's Worst" improv show at [Cafe The Joker](http://www.cafethejoker.be/) in september 2015, but is now used for training and performing quick-fire improv games in the style of "Lines You Wouldn't Hear" or "Worst possible <profession>". 

* For performances, you can configure how often the audience should be involved in making a suggestion. (Every X cards).
* Thanks to [Twinters](https://github.com/twinters), the app is now a mobile-compatible web app you can add to your home screen.

Latest version from master branch always live at **www.slechtstdenkbare.be**
